# **Every week, I write in my programmer's diary.**

## Content in file:
- Summaries of the work
This engineering journal documents my progress over 10 weeks of project development. Each week I've summarized the most important tasks I completed, including implementing features, designing databases, and conducting user testing. I've also focused on collaborating with my team, improving code quality, and preparing for the project's launch. This journal serves as a reflection on my experiences and lessons learned during the development process and provides an overview of the challenges I encountered and how I overcame them.
   
## 1. Summaries of the work (The things I have done every week: (update planning, engineer diary)
a) Collaboration with the team has been critical to the success of the project. Every week we have had meetings to discuss the progress of the project, distribute tasks, and solve problems that have arisen. By using GitHub, we have been able to share code, manage pull requests, and ensure that everyone is working on the same code base.

## (b) Configuration Management
We have implemented a robust configuration management process by using Git for version control. By creating separate branches for different functions, we have been able to work in parallel without disturbing the main project. Once a feature has been tested and approved, it has been merged into the master branch, ensuring continuous integration.

## (c) Implementation and Documentation
The implementation work has focused on developing new functions and improving existing components. Documentation has been created in parallel to ensure that all code is easy to understand and that instructions are provided on how to set up and use the system. Every week I have updated the documentation to reflect changes in the architecture or functionality.

## (d) Testing and Debugging
Testing has been a continuous process throughout the development work. at the end of the project, we've been running unit tests to ensure that new functionality works as expected and doesn't break previous code. Debugging has been challenging at times, but by analyzing error messages and using tools like breakpoints and logging, we've been able to solve most problems efficiently.

## Documented Debugging Experience
Debugging Session: Week 38
During week 38, we encountered a hard-to-find error in our ordering function in the BurgerOrderer module. The user was unable to submit their order, and no product selections were correctly recorded in the system. To solve this, we started by analyzing log files and stepped through the code with the debugger. By setting breakpoints, we were able to identify that the problem was in the handling of POST data from the HTML form. After we fixed the bug, we verified the functionality by running unit tests and manual tests, and the issue was resolved.

## Reflections:
Debugging was a learning process where we not only solved a technical problem but also gained insights into how important proper validation of user input is. We learned to improve our testing process by introducing more test cases to prevent similar bugs from occurring in the future.
