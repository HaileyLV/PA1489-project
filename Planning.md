# Planning
## 1. Form development team:
- Plan how you want to work: We sit together at least twice a week: Tuesday (after class) and Thursday (after the lab)

# 2. Determine development environment
- We use VS code.

# 3. Decide which git server you want to use
- Github
- We all have our own accounts on Github

# 4. Language:
- Python

# 5. Our products must have these features:
- A container-based platform, with separate containers for BurgerOrderer, KitchenView, and MenuStore.
**BurgerOrderer:** The main web interface. No need to make it fancy. Functionality is most important.
- Presents the different product types
- The customer can choose what they want to include in their order
- Customer **can customize their order** (eg remove “onions” from their “Metric Ton Bacon Burger”)
- Retrieves information about the different product types from the MenuStore database
- When the order is ready, it is sent via a REST call to KitchenView

**MenuStore**: A database that contains information about each type of item.
- Information about the different product types and how to customize them can be managed via a separate interface such as **admins**

**KitchenView**: Receives orders from BurgerOrderer and displays them to the kitchen staff.
- When an order is received via a REST API, it must be printed on the screen.
- Just need a simple text based printout.
